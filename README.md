### What Happens

1. **Small PDFs (‚â§50 pages)**: Converted to a single Markdown file
2. **Large PDFs (>50 pages)**: Automatically segmented into smaller PDFs (kept for reference) and corresponding Markdown files

### Examples

**Converting a small document:**
```bash
$ pdf2md report.pdf
PDF2MD converter initialized
Converting: report.pdf
PDF has 25 pages
Processing as single document
Created: report.md

‚úÖ Conversion completed successfully!
üìÑ Input: report.pdf
üìÅ Output directory: /current/directory
üìù Generated 1 markdown file(s):
   - report.md
```

**Converting a large document:**
```bash
$ pdf2md large-manual.pdf
PDF2MD converter initialized
Converting: large-manual.pdf
PDF has 150 pages
Large PDF detected (150 pages). Segmenting...
Processing segment: pages 1-50
Created segment: large-manual_pages_001-050.pdf -> large-manual_pages_001-050.md
Processing segment: pages 51-100
Created segment: large-manual_pages_051-100.pdf -> large-manual_pages_051-100.md
Processing segment: pages 101-150
Created segment: large-manual_pages_101-150.pdf -> large-manual_pages_101-150.md

‚úÖ Conversion completed successfully!
üìÑ Input: large-manual.pdf
üìÅ Output directory: /current/directory
üìù Generated 3 markdown file(s):
   - large-manual_pages_001-050.md
   - large-manual_pages_051-100.md
   - large-manual_pages_101-150.md
```

## Output Format

Each generated Markdown file includes:

- **Document header** with source information and metadata
- **Clean, structured content** extracted from the PDF
- **Preserved formatting** including headings, tables, and lists
- **Page range information** for segmented documents

Example output header:
```markdown
# Document Title

## Document Information

## How It Works

1. **Analysis**: Determines PDF size and complexity
2. **Segmentation**: Large PDFs are split into 50-page segments
3. **Conversion**: IBM Docling processes each PDF into high-quality Markdown
4. **Output**: Clean, readable Markdown files are created in the source directory

## Why PDF2MD?

- **Simple**: One command, clean output
- **Reliable**: Built on IBM Docling's industrial-strength PDF processing
- **Smart**: Automatically handles large files without memory issues
- **Fast**: Efficient processing even for complex documents
- **Flexible**: Works with any PDF - reports, manuals, articles, forms

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues
```bash
# If docling installation fails, try:
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install docling

# For Apple Silicon Macs:
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install docling
```

### Memory Issues with Large PDFs
The tool automatically segments large PDFs, but if you encounter memory issues:
- Ensure you have sufficient disk space for temporary files
- Close other applications to free up RAM

### Permission Issues
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x pdf2md.py

# Or run with Python directly
python pdf2md.py document.pdf
```
